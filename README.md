# Network-Intrusion-Detection
Elevate network security using real-time monitoring solution! NIDS, powered by the NSL-KDD dataset, detects and responds to suspicious activities, known attack signatures, and abnormal patterns. 
## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously monitors network traffic for potential intrusions.
- **NSL-KDD Dataset Integration:** Utilizes the NSL-KDD dataset for advanced detection capabilities.
- **Diverse Machine Learning Algorithms:** Employs a variety of algorithms to provide a comprehensive approach to intrusion detection.
- **Ensemble Methods:** Utilizes ensemble methods for improved overall performance and robustness.
- **Alerts and Notifications:** Generates immediate alerts and notifications for timely response and mitigation.
- **Easy Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with existing security infrastructure.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/piyush60629/Network-Intrusion-Detection.git

### Install Dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

### Run the NIDS:
   python app.py

### Machine Learning Algorithms
The NIDS project leverages a diverse set of machine learning algorithms, including:

Logistic Regression
Ridge Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
Decision Tree
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier
### Ensemble Methods
Consider exploring ensemble methods, such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting, to combine the strengths of multiple models for improved overall performance.

### Model Loading
Ensure that the necessary model files (model.pkl, logistic_regression_model.pkl, etc.) are present in the same directory as Flask application or provide the correct path when loading the models.
